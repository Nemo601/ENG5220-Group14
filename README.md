# 🗑️ Intelligent Classification Rubbish Bin (Team 14) 
**_"Smarter Sorting, Cleaner Future"_**


> Real-time Embedded System | Smart Waste Sorting | Environmental Automation | Raspberry Pi

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Intelligent Classification Rubbish Bin** is a real-time embedded system designed to address the inefficiencies in daily waste disposal. By leveraging computer vision and multiple sensors, the system automatically detects and classifies waste types—ensuring that items are sorted into the appropriate bins with precision.

This project improves sustainability by encouraging automated recycling, reducing human error, and enhancing overall waste management efficiency.

**Key Features:**
- Visual recognition of garbage using an onboard camera
- Real-time sensor-driven bin actuation
- Fully automatic multi-bin rotation using stepper motors
